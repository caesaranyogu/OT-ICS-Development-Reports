Why OT Security is important:

Attacks are doubling every year
- keeping people in jobs and businesses open is important to lots of families and livelihoods
- these people rely on us to do our jobs

Commodity OS and software are becoming more popular
- Windows everywhere

IT and OT are crossing over more
- cloud in OT
- AI being introduced to OT more and more
- have to nail fundamentals/basics before taking on the cloud and AI
- not enough training data for AI to do industrial 
- lots of environments where IT and OT dont work together
- ie active directory needed by OT from IT

We are not prepared for attacks:
- lots of environments (everywhere)
- farms, hospitals, refineries, power plants, water/wastewater, food and agriculture, manufacturing facilities, trains, planes and automobiles
- ICS is power, water, manufacturing, transportation
- not prepared for types of attacks
- ie 3 years to make a turbine. plant could be down for years

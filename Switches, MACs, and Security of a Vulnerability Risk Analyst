What I Learned

Understanding the Physical & Data Link Layers

Learned how Ethernet evolved from Token Bus → CSMA/CD → Switched Ethernet, shaping modern industrial networking.

Studied CAT cable standards (Cat3–Cat8), RJ45 terminations, and fiber optics, which are essential in plant floor and industrial environments.

Understood that the NIC (Network Interface Card) is the true interpreter of Ethernet — not the cable — teaching me how data transmission depends on device logic, not just wiring.

Switch Functionality & Network Behavior

Gained insight into MAC/CAM tables, how switches learn device locations, and what causes flooding when unknown MAC addresses appear.

Learned how network loops and broadcast storms can cripple entire operational segments — the same way loops in an ICS network can disrupt PLC communications or flight ops control systems.

Understood Spanning Tree (STP) and Rapid Spanning Tree (RSTP) as self-healing mechanisms for network redundancy — vital in critical infrastructure that cannot afford downtime.

Power & Hardware Reliability

Studied PoE negotiation (Alternative A/B/Four-Pair) — crucial for powering IP-based sensors, VoIP phones, cameras, and industrial IoT devices.

Reviewed how UPS systems, cooling, and proper airflow prevent failures in field switches or server racks — a common cause of OT incidents.


Challenges Faced

Clarifying whether a network adapter driver is a logical or physical component.

Understanding how token bus operates and how frames circulate without a physical loop.

Relating CSMA/CD collisions to multiple versions of self and spiritual harmony.

Grasping simplex, half-duplex, and full-duplex communication and how it affects network traffic.

Differentiating between show config, running-config, and startup-config on switches.

Distinguishing slots vs ports in networking hardware and understanding their roles.

Understanding PoE pair assignments and which pairs carry power versus data.

Visualizing MAC table flooding, network loops, and STP/RSTP convergence to prevent broadcast storms.


How I Solved Them

Prompt: “Explain why a network adapter driver is considered a logical component rather than a physical one, and how it interacts with hardware.”

Prompt: “Describe token bus operation. How does it transmit frames without forming a physical loop?”

Prompt: “Relate CSMA/CD to personal or spiritual growth. Use collisions as a metaphor for multiple versions of self trying to use the same body.”

Prompt: “Explain simplex, half-duplex, and full-duplex communication in simple terms, with analogies.”

Prompt: “Clarify the differences between show config, show running-config, and show startup-config on a switch.”

Prompt: “Differentiate a slot from a port in networking hardware, and explain their functions in practical terms.”

Prompt: “Explain PoE pair assignments (Alternative A/B, four-pair) in Ethernet cables, including which pairs carry data and power.”

Prompt: “Visualize how MAC table flooding and network loops happen, and how STP/RSTP prevents broadcast storms.”


Next Steps for Developing as a Risk Analyst

1. Master IP Addressing

IPv4: Understand how addresses are structured, subnet masks, CIDR notation, and how to calculate subnets.

IPv6: Learn address types (global unicast, link-local, multicast) and differences from IPv4.

Why it matters for risk analysis: Misconfigured IP addressing can expose networks to unauthorized access or routing failures.

2. Configure and Forward IP Networks

Practice assigning IP addresses to hosts and network devices.

Understand default gateways and how routers forward packets between networks.

Learn how routing tables work to direct traffic efficiently.

Risk perspective: Poor routing or misconfigured gateways can allow lateral movement by attackers or create availability issues.

3. Subnetting and Segmentation

Divide networks into subnets to isolate traffic and improve security.

Apply VLANs in combination with subnets to create logical segmentation for risk containment.

Risk perspective: Subnetting mistakes can create overly broad broadcast domains, increasing attack surfaces.

4. Use Diagnostic and Configuration Tools

Learn to use ping, traceroute, ipconfig/ifconfig, netstat, and ARP tables.

Practice identifying connectivity issues, duplicate IPs, and misconfigurations.

Risk perspective: Proficiency in tools helps quickly detect abnormal behavior or compromised hosts.

5. IP Troubleshooting

Apply troubleshooting methodology from Layer 2 to Layer 3.

Understand how IP conflicts, misconfigured subnets, or routing loops impact both availability and security.

Risk perspective: Effective troubleshooting allows you to detect and remediate misconfigurations before attackers exploit them.

6. Connect to OT/ICS Contexts

Map IP concepts to SCADA and ICS networks in water, power, or aviation.

Understand how field devices, sensors, and controllers rely on IP addressing for data flows.

Risk perspective: In OT environments, IP misconfigurations can impact safety and operational continuity.

7. Practical Lab Work

Build lab environments using Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3, or virtualized networks.

Configure hosts, routers, and subnets; test connectivity; simulate misconfigurations and their effects.

Risk perspective: Hands-on practice ensures theoretical knowledge translates to actionable security insight.

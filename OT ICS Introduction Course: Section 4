OT/ICS Introduction Course: Section 4

Threat and Vulnerability Management

- few people know it well in the OT space
- helps communicate during interviews

Importance of asset register
- basis for incident response
- also basis of vulnerability management
- we do not scan the OT environment

Risk = threat x vulnerability x probability x impact

Threat
- bad actors 
- accidental actions
- disgruntled employees
- extorted employees

Probability
- most OT environments most probabilistic threat is ransomware

Very little monitoring in OT so its hard to know if its an attack or something else
-this is mostly because most OT environments dont and will never have the budget for monitoring

CDP is good but they are having trouble with people having hardware and personnel to run it so very few people can take advantage

Communicating risk to business
- business people are smart but they just dont have the technical knowledge (bridging this gap is an important skill)
- they dont want to underspend but they also dont want to overspend
- need to know things like "if you are down for an hour, how much is it going to cost?"
  -some organizations really dont know
  -be prepared to have these conversations
  -IT has had these conversations forever, OT needs to get a lot better at these conversations

Vulnerability Management Process
 -IT
    -scan: Nexus scan
    -prioritize: what are the quick or critical vulnerabilities
      -CVSS scores
        -Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational
        -where is the asset in the environment (context matters)
      -starting point
      -important who is determining this score (junior analyst vs seasoned cyber lead who knows environment)
        -dont want to adjust more than 1 though (hard to explain to an auditor)
    -remediate: fix the issues
    -verify: verify they are actually fixed
    -scan for new vulnerability: how often you are scanning is important too
      -do you want to wait a month before scanning?? A lot might can happen between then
-OT
  1. Asset inventory
    -build asset registry
  2. Assign criticality
  3. Passive discovery of vulnerabilities
    -Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT) scanning - scanning before equipment gets put into environment
      -scanning firmware, default passwords, device hardening, patches, confirm security configurations, ensure equipment works under load
    -Site Acceptance Testing (SAT) scanning - scanning after equipment arrives on site but BEFORE put into production
      Nothing changed during shipping/installation
      Network connectivity follows the security design
      The system still passes security tests in the actual OT network
      Vulnerabilities introduced by integration (firewalls, historian connections, remote access)
      
      Safety protections are in place
  4. Validate with vendor
  5. Prioritize based on process/safety impact
  6. Apply patch OR compensating controls
  7. Implement during maintenance windows
  8. Verify changes
  9. Continuous monitoring

Threat Intel
-actionable information which an organization can use
-one of the best way to get buy-in from managment (talking about things that could happen in your environment)
  -research on chatgpt what are the top 10 incidents that happen in water, or fintech, or power etc
  -good to bring to clients and leadership
-not cheap resources
-ie CISA, ICS Advisory Project, SANS Internet Storm Center, Bleeping Computer, Security Wizardry Radar Page

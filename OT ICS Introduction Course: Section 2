OT/ICS Introduction Course: Section 2

OT/ICS Cybersecurity Overview

IT vs. OT
- IT in office
- OT in industrial environment
- likelihood of being killed in OT is much higher
- saftey in OT is top priority
- IT does CIA (Confidentiality at the top)
- OT does AIC (Availability at the top) 
- could have confidentialtity in OT (ie nuclear trade secrets)
- almost every OT is connected to IT
- IT does not need to send to OT usually (segmenting is a good idea)
  - makes direct attack vectors to OT
- OT could need to send to IT

IT
- store and process vast amounts of data
- laptops, workstations, servers

OT
- ICS how a LAN works
- SCADA how a WAN works
- uses MODBUS protocol
- cyber threat can be anything that comes in over a network connection or from cyber asset
- number one concern is physical safety

What is necessary communication between OT and IT
- segmentation
- firewall
- backup and recovery

Common ways attackers enter OT networks
- IT
- remote access
  -made for critical environments
  -lots of plants have issures with this
- physical transitory cyber assets
  -usb
  -cell phones connected to ports for "charging"
- control systems exposed to the internet
  -phones can break the airgap
- malicious insiders
  -engineers that understand how environment works is dangerous

Every company will get compromised
- will you be able to respond
- will you be able to detect it

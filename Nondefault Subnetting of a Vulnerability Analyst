What Did I Learn (Applied to Vulnerability & Risk)


Non-default subnet masks (/28, /27, /26)

Understanding subnet boundaries helps analysts identify potential misconfigurations that could lead to unauthorized access or lateral movement within networks.

Incorrect subnet masks causing routing issues

Misconfigured masks can force traffic through gateways unnecessarily, which may expose sensitive control systems to more monitoring points or interception.

ARP and MAC table behavior

Knowing how IP addresses resolve to MACs allows analysts to detect ARP spoofing attacks, MAC flooding, or unauthorized devices on OT networks.

APIPA addresses (169.254.x.x)

Recognizing when a host auto-assigns an address indicates DHCP failure or network isolation, which is crucial for identifying shadow devices or misconfigured systems.

Remote host MAC resolution via gateway

Analysts can track how traffic is routed, identify points of interception, and audit routing paths for potential risk exposure.

Broadcast behavior of hubs and bridges

Understanding broadcast flooding helps detect traffic amplification vulnerabilities and prevents sensitive OT/ICS networks from being exposed to unnecessary traffic.

Overly broad subnet masks

Large subnets may allow unauthorized access to devices thought to be isolated, which is a key risk factor in industrial networks.

IPv6 link-local and global addressing

Awareness of automatic and global addresses helps analysts audit IPv6-enabled devices, ensuring they aren’t inadvertently exposing OT/ICS systems to external networks.

VLSM subnet design

Correct subnet allocation is vital for network segmentation, minimizing exposure of critical systems and reducing attack surfaces.


Challenges Faced in a Security Context

Detecting subnet misconfigurations that could lead to lateral movement or policy violations.

Identifying hosts with incorrect mask configurations that may inadvertently expose sensitive OT assets.

Distinguishing between legitimate ARP traffic and ARP-based attacks.

Spotting devices with APIPA addresses that could indicate mismanaged or rogue systems.

Understanding routing paths to audit for vulnerable gateways or misrouted traffic.

Recognizing broadcast-heavy segments that could amplify Denial-of-Service risks.

Calculating subnet allocations to ensure segmentation policies minimize attack surfaces.


How I Solved Them (Applied to Risk Analysis)

Q1: How can I identify which hosts belong to the same subnet to assess exposure risk?
A1: Convert IPs to binary and compare network bits — helps map asset groupings for vulnerability scanning.

Q2: What happens when subnet masks are misconfigured in sensitive networks?
A2: Devices may unintentionally send traffic via gateways, exposing control traffic to unmonitored paths or logging points.

Q3: How do ARP and MAC tables affect network security monitoring?
A3: Monitoring MAC-to-port and IP-to-MAC mappings lets analysts detect spoofing, unauthorized devices, and port misuse.

Q4: Why is an APIPA address a red flag in a secure network?
A4: Indicates network segmentation or DHCP misconfiguration — could allow rogue or shadow devices to exist unnoticed.

Q5: How does MAC resolution for remote hosts assist risk assessment?
A5: Ensures routing is as expected, helps locate potential interception points, and identifies misconfigured gateways.

Q6: Why understand broadcast handling in legacy devices?
A6: Broadcast flooding can create traffic amplification vulnerabilities or expose sensitive devices in OT networks.

Q7: How does a broad subnet mask affect vulnerability exposure?
A7: Large subnets may allow unauthorized access across devices, bypassing intended segmentation policies.

Q8: How does IPv6 link-local/global addressing impact risk monitoring?
A8: Analysts can audit automatically assigned addresses to ensure OT/ICS devices aren’t unintentionally exposed externally.

Q9: Why is VLSM important for risk mitigation?
A9: Proper subnetting enforces network segmentation, reduces attack surface, and ensures critical devices are isolated from potential threats.


Next Steps for Vulnerability & Risk Analysts

Practice mapping network topologies to identify misconfigurations, rogue devices, and exposed paths.

Audit subnet masks across OT/ICS environments for compliance with segmentation policies.

Monitor ARP tables and MAC-to-port mappings for signs of spoofing or unauthorized devices.

Identify APIPA hosts or misrouted traffic for deeper investigation.

Evaluate IPv6 deployments to ensure global addresses do not expose critical systems.

Apply VLSM and subnet planning principles to enforce segmentation and minimize attack surfaces.

Test broadcast-heavy segments for amplification risks or accidental exposure of sensitive devices.

Integrate routing and switching knowledge into vulnerability scanning workflows to improve coverage of all network paths.

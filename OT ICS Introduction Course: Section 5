OT/ICS Introduction Course: Section 5

OSINT for Industrial Controls
whole course on this is on Mike's youtube

What is OSINT? (Open Source Intelligence)
-Intelligence gathered from publicly available data
  -the more relevant the better
-pnetesters use this often
-types:
  -humint (from humans spies)
  -sigint (from signal intercepts)
  -comint (communications intelligince)
  -elint (electronic intelligence)

How attackers get in OT network
-from IT (remote access)
-physical cyber assets
-control systems exposed to the internet
-Exploit database (online website)
  -has known exploits for pentesters

Incidence Respomse:

Phase 1: Preparation
-policies guidelines and procedures
-identifying and training team members
-determine out of band communication
-build our response toolkit
-tabletop exercises
  -make sure there are no single points of failures

IR Team members
-bring in people as you need them (controls chaos and narrative control)
-IR Team lead
-Plant Manager
-ICS/OT Cybersecurity Manager
-Control System Engineers
-Process Engineers
-Network Engineers
-Cybersecurity Analysts
-Incident Responders
  -Mandios, Dragos
    -comes with paperwork so be prepared before time
-Legal
-HR
-Compliance
-Outside Parties

Phase 2: Identification
-Use security tools for detection
-monitor network traffic for clues
-monitor endpoint activity for clues
-detection of suspicious anomalies
-determine an insident is occuring
-collect and correlate data
-leverage cyber threat intelligence
